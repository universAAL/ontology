Development notes for the ActivityHub Ontology in uAAL
by Thomas Fuxreiter

NOTE1: In the standard specification (ISO 11073-10471) the sensors are defined as enumeration objects.
Each enum object has one or more types. Most of the specified sensor enums have just one type.
E.g. fall sensor enum has just one type which is named "SENSOR_FALL".
Wherelse environmental sensor enum has 4 types: SENSOR_SMOKE, SENSOR_CO, SENSOR_WATER and SENSOR_GAS.

For the current implementation of the ActivityHub ontology I reduced the model to a flat list of sensors.
Therefore fall sensor, smoke sensor and so on are side by side in the ontology model without taking care
of the enum sensor objects defined in the standard.
If necessary this should be upgraded in future.

NOTE2: Generic sensor properties flags are defined for all activity hub sensors. If those flags have to be 
considered in the ontology an intermediate class with those properties should be defined (name could be
"ActivityHubSensor") which extends the class org.universAAL.ontology.phThing.Sensor. All other activity hub
sensor classes should extend the new class furthermore; not the Sensor class directly.

NOTE3: The ontology is designed according to the measurement ontology example from the uAAL ontology workshop
in Darmstadt (Dec 2011)
